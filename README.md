# Coming Soon
A "Coming Soon" website, also known as an "Under Construction" or "Teaser" website, is a temporary web page that is set up by businesses, individuals, or organizations to announce the impending launch of a new website or project. It serves as a placeholder to inform visitors that something new and exciting is on the way, even though the full website content or functionality is not yet available.
